This is a portfolio website that showcases my work using Next.js. The website is fully responsive and optimized for different devices and screen resolutions. It also features a full stack functionality that enables me to log in as an admin and manage all the projects I have uploaded, such as editing, updating, or deleting them.

## Technologies used 

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking and other features.
- **MongoDB**: A document-based database for storing and querying data.
- **Next Auth**: A library for implementing authentication and authorization in Next.js applications.

## Features
- **Fully responsive**: The website adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across all platforms.
- **Multipage layout**: The website consists of multiple pages, each with a specific purpose and content. You can navigate between the pages using the menu bar at the top.
- **Admin dashboard**: The website provides a secure and user-friendly dashboard for the admin to manage the projects. The admin can log in, edit, update, or delete the projects as needed.
